# StepTracker
A small application build to track Stepmania play time.

It reads the GamplaySeconds value from a Stepmania Profile and shows the hours played as well as a progress bar counting towards 100 the year. You can also display the combined time of multiple profiles and add play time manually to a profile.

This was build for the Get Up and Move 100 hour challenge where everyone tries to play a total of 100 hours of any arrow stomping game in the year 2016. You can join the [Facebook group here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1664262093848408/).

###Download
**IMPORTANT:** Please make a backup of your profile before using this. While it should only read from the profile I can not promise that nothing will break.

###How to use:
Before playing start the application once. If you have multiple profiles select one close the application and repeat this for every profile you want to track.
After this just open the application when you finished a session of playing Stepmania. It will prompt that it found new data and ask you if you want to use this data. If you played with your keyboard or something and therefore don't want this data to be included in the total just click No.
After confirming the dialog you will see the progress bar with your tracked hours.
It's as simple as that.
If you want to add data manual just click the button and add the information.
To display multiple profiles click the "Add Profile to View" button and select a profile. This will add the data of the selected profile to the view. The effect is only visual. Nothing changes storage wise.

Please let me know if anything breaks, you have some trouble or if you have suggestions. I am already tracking the played sessions by date so a monthly evaluation would be a possibility in the future.
